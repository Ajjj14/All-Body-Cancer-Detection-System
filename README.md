# All-Body-Cancer-Detection-System
We use VGG-16, Efficient Net, ResNet, and Ensemble models with SHAP AI for multi-cancer detection. These models classify cancer images, while SHAP AI improves interpretability by identifying key features. This approach enhances accuracy, aids early diagnosis, and supports medical decisions by revealing critical cancer characteristics.
